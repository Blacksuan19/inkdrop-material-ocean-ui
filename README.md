# Material-Ocean-UI

Material Ocean UI theme for Inkdrop.

**NOTE:** At the moment, not all components of the UI are styled properly. All components you are likely to run into in day to day usage are styled (creating notebooks, creating notes, viewing revision history, creating notes, etc.) are styled, but components such as the settings menu are not completely styled.
